Eigen Magma
===========
MAGMA is a solid implementation of BLAS and linear algebra routines for multicore and GPU systems: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/index.html

Optional support of MAGMA in Eigen for large dense matrix computations would allow applications written using Eigen to profit from GPU and multi-GPU support of
MAGMA.

This project is a fork of Eigen 3.2 to use MAGMA (tested with version 1.4.0-beta2) as backend.
